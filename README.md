Problem Statement


Drug–drug interactions (DDIs) occur when the pharmacological effect of one drug is altered by another, potentially causing adverse effects, reduced efficacy, or serious harm. With increasing polypharmacy (patients taking multiple drugs simultaneously), manually checking interactions is error-prone and time-consuming for clinicians and pharmacists.
Goal: Build an AI system that accurately detects and explains potential harmful drug pairs from a given list of medications using real interaction data.
